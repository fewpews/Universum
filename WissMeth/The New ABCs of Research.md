# The New ABCs of Research
#### Linear Model(Vannevar Bush 1945):
- Basisc Research -> Applied Research -> Development -> Production & Operations
- Simple, but flawed

## Context
- Immense problems 
- New Technologies
- Raised Ambitions

## Guiding Principles
#### ABC Principle
- **A**pplied & **B**asic **C**ombined
- Combining *applied* with *basic* research produces more rapid progress in both
	- practical problem
	- theoretical approach
	- develop potential solution
	- test it in the real world
	- refine theory
	- [[Scientific Literature#Publication Location/Search/Retrieval|publish results]] in academic environments

		- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
	- disseminate practical solution

#### SED Principle
- **S**cience, **E**ngineering & **D**esign 
- Blending these produces higher-impact research

## Lifecycle Strategies
- Choose actionable problems
- Apply observations, intervention & controlled experiments
- Form teams with diverse Individuals/Organisations
- Test ideas/prototypes with realistic interventions
- Promote adoption & assess impact

## New Knowledge
- Solutions
- Theories
