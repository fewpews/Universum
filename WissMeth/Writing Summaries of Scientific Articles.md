# Writing Summaries of Scientific Articles
- write summaries of interesting articles and later potentially relate to it when writing a paper about a related field


## Preparation
### Read
#### Read the Abstract
- short paragraph summarizing the article
	- highly condensed, cannot provide same level of detail like a summary
- **Purpose**: quickly scan article, providing important highlights of study

### Understand
#### Understand the Context of the Research
- what will be discussed/analysed?
- why it matters?
- other articles?
- -> gives you the arguments, quotes, data for your summary

#### Skip to the Conclusion
- easire to comprehend information and understand where the complicated outlines/arguments are leading to 

### Main Argument
#### Identify the Main Argument/Position of the Article
- take notes, underline/highlight main ideas
- beginning paragraphs -> thesis and main argument/idea
- **indicator words:** hypothesis, results, typically, generally, clearly

### Scan
#### Scan the Argument
- read through important segments/sub-sections
- don't read word-for-word
- don't lose main argument out of sight
- focus on key concepts/ideas

### Take Notes
#### Take Notes While You Read
- active reading
- **Important**: indtroduction, methodology, reasearch results, conclusion

### Free-Write
#### Write Down a Brief Description of the Research
- flow chart showing process from starting point to concluding results
	- rewrite main argument in own words
	- describe methodology and form of study

### Main Ideas
#### Decide What Aspects of the Article are Most Important
- main supporting ideas/sections
	- any major point used to suppport main argument
- may describe theoretical background or assumptions of researcher
- summarize statistical results and rudimentary interpretation of data


## Summary
- Research Question, Conclusion/Results, How Results were Achieved

### Present Tense
#### Use Present Tense
- helps maintain a parallel grammatical structure

### Major Keywords
#### Identify Key Vocabulary to Use in the Summary
- all the major keywords
- fully examine meanings of these more complicated terms

### Brief
#### Aim to Keep It Brief
- condensed but separate description of research
- several short paragraphs that summarize each seperate portion of the article

### Define Research
#### Start by Defining the Research Questions
- start with **focus of research** study and **targeted objectives** for conducting study 
	- -> found in introduction
- **main argument** in own words
	- **research question** and **testing procedures**

### Methodology
#### Discuss the Methodology Used by the Authors
- research tools/methods used during study
	- how authors came to conclusion with first-hand research and collected data
	- reduced to simple idea how research question was adressed
	- processed data needs to be included

### Results
#### Describe the Results
- accomplished results of work
	- successful? meet objectives? what conclusion? implications of research?

### Opinion
#### Own Conclusions?
- summarize authors point not own additions/editorials
	- but depends on the assignment

### Quotes
#### Refrain from using direct Quotations of Text from the Journal Article
- less important for journal article summary
- focus on paraphrasing the ideas without losing meaning/intended content
	- direct quote when no other sensible way of paraphrasing

### Revise
#### Revise Your Draft
- good writing -> in revision
- compare focus/content of summary to article
