# Ethics in Research
Ethics in research refers to the set of moral principles and standards that guide researchers during the course of their research. It includes considerations of what is right and wrong, good and bad, just and unjust. It focuses on the implications of research decisions and actions on all those involved in the process â€“ researchers, participants, organizations, society, and future generations.

## Ethical Principles in Research
### Informed Consent
- **Disclosure & Comprehension**
	- (limited) Purpose of research
	- Procedure
	- Risks/Benefits
	- Voluntary participation
	- Offer to answer questions
- **Voluntariness & Decision**
	- Paricipation conditions free of coercion and influence
	- Terminate participation at any time
- **Documentation**
	- Contains disclosure of research
	- Partial
		- If full disclosure would affect research goals negatively **and** deception involves acceptable disadvantages for paritipants
		- "Deceptive" at beginning, full after research
		- Social/Computer science
	- Full
		- Every detail revealed, even RQ and H
		- Medical/Health science

### Beneficence
- **Welfare of participants is a goal of the study**
	- minimise harm
	- consider all kinds of potential harm 
		- stress, loss of dignity, disruption of day-to-day activites, tedium, finacial losses
		- In computer science harm often breaches of confidentiality
- **Weighting harms and benefits**

### Confidentiality
- Subjects' right to expect that any information they share with researches will remain confidential 
- **Data privacy**
	- Limitations imposed on access to collected data
	- Password/Lock protected
	- Few people access
- **Data anonymity**
	- When data is examined, no identity is revealed
		- BOTH organisations and subjects
	- Disclose the level of anonymity before starting
- **Anonymity of participation**
	- Hiding identity from colleagues/bosses/competitors/public/...
		- Strategy: sample from pool of participants
		- Prvate areas/times for interviewing
	- Name of organisations should not be disclosed
		- If the organisation requests for it, tell them the fallbacks

### Scientific Value
- If study is not methodologically valid
	- results will not reflect reality
	- no benefit
- If no benefit, not undertake the study
- Grasping scientific value needs replication

## Ethical Principles: Formal
### Project Review
- long, time consuming
- needs lots of documentation
- Common Rule
	- Humans Subjects -> Ethics preview
	- Humans Subjects: When identifiable private information is collected (!= made public)
- Review:
	- Institutional Review Board
	- Ethics Review Board
	- Authority to modify/terminate research projects
	- Exemptions
		- Surveys and develompent of educational tests
		- Not collecting information leading to identification
